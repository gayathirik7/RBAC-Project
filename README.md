# Role-Based Access Control UI with React and TailwindCSS

This repository contains a simple Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI built using **React** for the front-end, and **TailwindCSS** for styling. The app demonstrates how to handle user roles, restrict access to certain parts of the application, and render UI elements dynamically based on the user's role.

## Features

- **Role-based UI rendering**: Components are shown or hidden based on the user's role (e.g., Admin, User, Guest).
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides an easy and responsive design.
- **React**: A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Context API for managing user roles**: Global state management to handle and pass down user roles through the component tree.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-ui-react-tailwind.git
cd rbac-ui-react-tailwind
